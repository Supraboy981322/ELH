<h1 align="center">ELH (Embed Languages in HTML)</h1>

>[!WARNING]
>HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT!

Freely embed various programming languages into HTML; like PHP, but without being bound to one language.

---

### Usage examples

- list files in directory with Bash
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <body>
    <h1>files</h1>
    <ul>
      <$bash
        for file in $(ls); do
          printf "<li>$file</li>\n"
        done
      $>
    </ul>
  </body>
  ```
